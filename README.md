| Project Overview: Image Pixel Coordinate Calculator
| Description: A Web API that accepts POST Requests for calculating pixel coordinates for rendering an image.
| It takes requests that include floating-point coordinates representing the bounding corners of  the image,
| and a pair of integers for the number of pixel rows and pixel columns in the image to be rendered. It  
| returns a matrix (nested 2D JSON array) of points as the result.
---
| Details: The web service is made in Python using FastAPI with Pydantic for model-based validation
| of inputs and formatting of outputs.
